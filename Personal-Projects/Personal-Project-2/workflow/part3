1. Create a user with the power role.
Username: power
Password: #######

2. Started working on the splunk lab. While uploading practice data to splunk, splunk crashed. 

3. I determined the AWS free EC2 instance option wasn't able to keep up with splunk. 

4. Turned off the splunk-dev EC2 instance and changed the instance type.
- Changed instance type from t2.micro to c4.2xlarge

5. Also had to add changes to the server.conf file in order to upload the lab data.
vim /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/server.conf
[queue=parsingQueue]
maxSize = 10MB
[queue=indexqueue]
maxSize = 10MB
[diskUsage]
minFreeSpace = 1000

6. Completed the Splunk 7.x Fundamentals training.
