1. Created a version 2 of my ec2 launcher playbook in order to be more dynamic and allow variables for instance name and security group.
- EC2 Instance: AWS-Ansible-Control
- Private IP: 172.31.29.165
- Elastic IP: 34.226.92.114
- User: ec2-user
sudo vim /etc/ansible/playbooks/launch-ec2-instance-v2.yaml

2. Ran the launch-ec2-instance-v2 playbook
- EC2 Instance: AWS-Ansible-Control
- Private IP: 172.31.29.165
- Elastic IP: 34.226.92.114
- User: ansible
ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/playbooks/launch-ec2-instance-v2.yaml -e "group_name=Splunk-Wordpress-SG name_tag=AWS-Docker-Wordpress"

3. Added the new EC2 instance to the Ansible hosts/inventory file under its own group and also updated the group structure
- EC2 Instance: AWS-Ansible-Control
- Private IP: 172.31.29.165
- Elastic IP: 34.226.92.114
- User: ec2-user

- EC2 Instance: aws-docker-wordpress
- Private IP: 172.31.25.43
- Public IP: 54.221.68.195
- User: ec2-user
sudo useradd ansible
sudo passwd ansible
#######
sudo visudo
- "ansible         ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL"
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
- "PasswordAuthentication yes"
sudo systemctl restart sshd

5. Set up password-less SSH between aws-ansible-control and new aws-docker-wordpress EC2 instance
- EC2 Instance: AWS-Ansible-Control
- Private IP: 172.31.29.165
- Elastic IP: 34.226.92.114
- User: ansible

- Private IP: 172.31.29.165
- Elastic IP: 34.226.92.114
- User: ansible
ansible docker-wordpress -m ping
[ansible@aws-ansible-control ~]$ ansible docker-wordpress -m ping
172.31.25.43 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
