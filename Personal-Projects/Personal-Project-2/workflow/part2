1. Reserved a domain name for 1 year with AWS Route 53 for the splunk-dev EC2 instance. Name is: splunk-dev.link
- Domain name: splunk-dev.link
- Price: $5.00
- Turned off automatic renewal
- Check progress here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home#DomainRequests:

2. Configured Route 53 - Network Load Balancer, target group, registered target, and Route 53 A records.
- EC2 > Load Balancers > Created load balancer named: splunk-LB
- EC2 > Target Groups > Created target group named: splunk-target-group
- EC2 > Target Groups > splunk-target-group > Register Targets > chose the splunk-dev instance and set the port for 8000 > Include as pending below
- Route 53 > Under DNS Management > Click Hosted Zone > Chose my splunk-dev.link domain > Chose the A record > Edit Record > Routed traffic to the Network Load Balancer (NLB)

3. While these DNS changes propogated, I used the EC2 Public IPv4 DNS assigned by AWS.

4. Later confirmed that the entire configuration (Network Load Balancer, target group, registered target, and Route 53 A records) were working properly by hitting the splunk-dev.link:8000 page successfully
